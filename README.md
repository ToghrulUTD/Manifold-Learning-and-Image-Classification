# Digit-recognizer
This repository includes digit recognition project. The notebook includes 

1. Linear projection methods (PCA, LDA)
2. Manifold learning, nonlinear dimensionality reduction with UMAP and TSNE
3. Outlier detection + dimensionality reduction (LocalOutlierFactor)
4. Logistic regression, Random Forest classification for digit recognition
5. ConvNET for digit recognition and hyperparameter tuning
6. Comparison of these different approaches

The dataset is relatively small (70,000 handwritten images and labels) and is intended for trying state of the art methods and comparing them with traditional methods in terms of performance and efficiency.
